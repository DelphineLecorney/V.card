# V.card
> Creation of a virtual card with Grid and Flexbox

*Use "modern" positioning techniques using the grid or flexbox model.
Create and use a wireframe if needed
Use git branches*

> Create a new repository called VCard and use one of the css positioning techniques stated above!

*Once the V-Card is finished, let's try to recreate the project with another positioning technique (if we used flex, this time use grid and vice-versa) on a new branch.*
